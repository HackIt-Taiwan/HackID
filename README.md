Introduction to Lark
To enhance the convenience of collaboration, we have chosen Lark (飛書) as our primary collaboration software. Lark is a tool designed specifically to improve work efficiency and team collaboration. It integrates a variety of practical office applications such as Word, Excel, mind maps, flowcharts, a whiteboard feature similar to Miro, and multi-dimensional tables. Additionally, Lark incorporates meeting and calendar functionalities, making the collaboration process smoother.

Although Lark offers a wealth of features, you do not need to master all the tools from the beginning. We recommend starting by familiarizing yourself with the overall interface and basic functions, and gradually exploring and learning these tools. Over time, you will find that Lark significantly enhances your efficiency and your team's collaboration capabilities.

You can quickly learn how to use Lark through the following videos:
